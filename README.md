# 15 Days Landing Page Challenge

This is my first landing page. [I'm currently taking a Full Stack Web Development course at FLAG](https://flag.pt/curso/full-stack-web-developer/), and this landing page borns as a 15 days challenge after the HTML and CSS modules.

Building this project was a lot of fun, and the more I progressed, the more engaged I was. I'm currently becoming more and more passionate about Web Development, and hope to being able to showcase here many more projects.
